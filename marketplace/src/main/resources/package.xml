  <title>Nuxeo Diff</title>
  <description>
    <p>This addon adds the Diff functionality to Nuxeo. It allows to compare 2 documents or 2 versions of a document,
    for example if you need to list the changes between 2 versions of functional specifications.</p>
    <p>The comparison is based on the properties shared by the 2 documents.
    This means that if a comparison is done between two documents of a different type, only the schemas in common will be "diffed".
    The result of the comparison only shows the properties that have been updated, or added / deleted in the case of multivalued properties.</p>
    <p>The comparison takes into account metadata as well as binary content for standard file formats:
    <i>.doc, .docx, .odt, .xls, .xlsx, .ods, .ppt, .pptx, .odp, .pdf, .txt, .html, .xml, .md</i>.
    The content diff is displayed in the usual way by highlighting the added changes in green and the deleted ones in red.</p>
    <p>The Diff feature provides extension points that allow to configure the diff display for each document type using <i>diff blocks</i> and <i>widgets</i>.
    You can also contribute extra <i>content differs</i> to handle specific file types such as images.</p>
    <p>In terms of user interface, the Diff addon adds a "Compare" button to all the document list views, including Archived versions, Search results, Sections, Trash, etc.
    You can also compare 2 documents added to the Worklist.</p>
